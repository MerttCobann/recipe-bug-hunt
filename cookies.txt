 Reflection Questions – Recipe Bug Hunt

1. How many times did you have to check the temperature before Git found the bug?
I had to check a few times, around 3 times, before Git told me which commit was bad.
Each time I looked at the “Temperature” line and wrote either git bisect good or git bisect bad.

2. If you had 100 commits instead of 7, about how many checks would bisect need?
It would only need around 7 checks, because bisect uses something like a shortcut called binary search.
So it doesn’t have to go through every single commit.

3. How is bisect different from manually checking each commit with git checkout?
If I check commits one by one, it takes a lot of time.
With git bisect, Git automatically jumps to the middle of the commits and helps me find the bad one much faster.
So it saves a lot of time and effort.

4. When would git bisect be most useful in real projects?
It’s most useful when a project has a lot of commits and suddenly something breaks,
but you don’t know which commit caused it.
Bisect helps you find that bad commit quickly without checking them all.

5. What information do you need to start a bisect session?
You need to know one “good” commit where everything worked fine
and one “bad” commit where the bug exists.
Then Git can compare them and find the problem in between.
